# Nitrogen-prediction-using-multispectral-images
Total Nitrogen Estimation in Agricultural Soils via Aerial Multispectral Imaging and LIBS.
# Training-and-HPO
Perform training on the dataset using the multispectral characteristics of the soil and crops in red, near-infrared, and green spectral bands, computedvegetation indices, and environmental variables including air temperature and relative humidity and perfromed hyper-parameter optimization to improve the prediction accuracy.
# dataset-LIBS
To generate the ground-truthdata or the training data for the machine learning models, we measure the total nitrogen of the soil samples (collected from afarm) using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS).
